                <h4>Slack</h4>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>
                Slack is a website that acts as a collaboration hub that allows people to work together by allowing them 
                to upload work, their ideas, and use different tools. 
                </li>
                <li>
                I have used Slack where I was able to see what people were uploading and also share
                solutions in identifying problems, sharing pages to help people not only find solutions their looking
                for, but also use new ideas to for their project.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>
                GitHub is seen as a learning lab where developers can upload their projects for people to see and also giving 
                feedback and what and how they can improve on their work. 
                </li>
                <li>
                I have also used GitHub where I was able to upload work that I have done onto a repository so that not
                only it would be saved onto for later use, but also allow other GitHub users to see what I have done
                by scrolling through the code.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Git</h4>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>
                Git is seen as a free and open source where it allows developers and users to track changes in computer files, 
                upload their files and projects to their GitHub and also check their status to ensure that they have been selected 
                when attempting to upload to GitHub. This can handle any project whether it is small or large.
                </li>
                <li>
                I have also used Git where I was able to use different commands to create a new repository,
                display the state of the directory that was being worked on, add a file name, record any
                changes to the repository, and uploading the local repository to the remote repository.
                </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                    The Risks of Collaborative Technologies

                        <li>
                            By looking at these collaborative technologies they can pose a risk when it comes to sharing as
                            they seem to allow anything to be uploaded to the webpages, for example if someone was to upload 
                            sensitive information on Slack this would be visible for everyone to see. And they also pose a risk 
                            when it comes to uploading their work as they can not only encourage someone to take that work but
                            could also mean that they may not look for different solutions when creating their own website.

                                By looking at these different technologies and how they work they are very essential to modern development
                                as they are helpful technologies that allow people to upload their projects they have done, 
                                help them show and come up with different ideas and solutions for their work.
